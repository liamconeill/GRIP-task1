# GRIP-task1
The task is to predict a student's score based upon the number of hours they study. We will accomplish this by training a model and use it to predict the score of a student who studies for 9.25 hours per day. The data set has been provided for us and contains a .csv file with the number of hours a student has studied and their score.
